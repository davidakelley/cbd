% SEASBREAKS (overloaded) produces special plots showing potential seasonal breaks
%
% Usage:
%   seasbreaks(obj)
%   seasbreaks(..., 'dropcomposite')
%   seasbreaks(..., options)
%   fh = seasbreaks(...)
%
% Inputs:
%   obj            A x13composite object.
%   dropcomposite  Do not plot the composite series.
%   options        Any options passed on to x13series.plot.
%
% Outputs:
%   fh          An array of handles to the figures that are created.
%
% x13composite.seasbreaks really functions like x13series.seasbreaks, where
% all series contained in the composite object are passed as individual
% series to the x13series.seasbreaks routine.
% 
% NOTE: This file is part of the X-13 toolbox.

% History:
% 2017-01-09    Version 1.30    First release featuring camplet.
% 2016-07-10    Version 1.17.1  Improved guix. Bug fix in x13series relating to
%                               fixedseas.
% 2016-07-06    Version 1.17    First release featuring guix.
% 2016-03-10    Version 1.16.1  Added 'dropcomposite' option.
% 2016-03-03    Version 1.16    Adapted to X-13 Version 1.1 Build 26.
% 2015-08-20    Version 1.15    Significant speed improvement. The imported
%                               time series will now be mapped to the first
%                               day of month if this is the case for the
%                               original data as well. Otherwise, they will
%                               be mapped to the last day of the month. Two
%                               new options --- 'spline' and 'polynomial'
%                               --- for fixedseas. Improvement of .arima,
%                               bugfix in .isLog.
% 2015-07-25    Version 1.14    Improved backward compatibility. Overloaded
%                               version of seasbreaks for x13composite. New
%                               x13series.isLog property. Several smaller
%                               bugfixes and improvements.
% 2015-07-24    Version 1.13.3  Resolved some backward compatibility
%                               issues (thank you, Carlos).
% 2015-07-07    Version 1.13    seasma removed, replaced by fixedseas.
%                               Complete integration of fixedseas into
%                               x13spec, with fore-/backcast extension
%                               before computing trend for simple seasonal
%                               adjustment. Various improvemnts to
%                               x13series.plot (including 'separate' 
%                               option). seasbreaks program to identify
%                               seasonal breaks. Better support for PICKMDL
%                               model list files. Added '-n' to list of
%                               default flags in x13. Select print requests
%                               added as default in makespec.
% 2015-05-21    Version 1.12    Several improvements: Ensuring backward
%                               compatibility back to 2012b (possibly
%                               farther); Added 'seasma' option to x13;
%                               Added RunsSeasma to x13series; other
%                               improvements throughout. Changed numbering
%                               of versions to be in synch with FEX's
%                               numbering.
% 2015-04-28    Version 1.6     x13as V 1.1 B 19
% 2015-01-04    Version 1.1     Adapting to some changes in the
